0,Sai Phani,4.0,Cute yet very ü§ì smart,Loved it's functionality and user experience in the alexa app. My daughter enjoys cocomelon songs on a loop. Keeps me updated with my reminders and shopping lists. Such a handy help around the house! Enables IOT and home automation like it's a piece of üç∞.
1,Aarti,4.4,Need update 5thb g alexa,"Alexa tell only few story and repeated all things , alexa dnt play marathi song she knew only jio sawan songs"
2,Anirban Saha,4.4,Needs a lot of improvements.,"a. Occupancy sensor:- At times when I study, it does not detect me. It switches off appliances because I have set a routine. To appear like a human being, at times I move while seated on my chair.- There is no proper documentation for this feature. I had to have three different conversations with the customer care to understand the feature.b. Temperature detection:- It does not always work. There are times that it detected higher temperature and switched my AC on. Most of the time, it does not detect when the room temperature falls below a certain point; and thus, it does not switch the AC off.- Continuing with the previous statement: I think it checks periodically for the temperature and it is not done real time. For example: If the routine says to switch the AC off if the temperature drops below 23, there are times it switched the AC off at 22.5 and there were times when the room was at 19 degrees but still the AC was not switched off automatically. I am told by the customer care that my device is faulty. I have asked for a replacement of the product."
3,Shekath A.,4.0,Device is good but...,But need to be more user friendly like FM radio not directly linked only All in India Radio is playing. Need to be more flexible as Google
4,Prasun Kr. Bhattacharjee,4.1,Very nice,Experience is being gathered. Will review after some time
5,Harrish,4.5,Good for first time users But unfair.,I'm using alexa product for first time so loving it as of now ...But it's very very unfair that Amazon is not showing clock on display in India....very unfair and reducing my rating for that..
6,Dr. RAGHU CHANDRA GARIMELLA,4.0,Excellent companion with minor bugs,"It is an excellent companion. However, it has few flaws as listed below (as per two days of usage):1. Playing same songs again and again. Forcing to buy a package from the music partners. Also, the playlist always starts from the same song and continues the same list (even though shuffle is enabled). That's why 1 star less.2. Not giving appropriate answers sometimes.3. Not having a memory like Google Assistant. Not remembering the things happened.4. Even though, profile is created for specific person, it is responding to all voices. No use for profile creation except remembering the profile name.Overall, it needs a few updates to solve the bugs. However, it's the best companion and a new family member."
